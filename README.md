OpenGL Scene Overview

Welcome to my immersive OpenGL scene, where cutting-edge graphics techniques and interactive controls converge to create a dynamic exploration environment. This project showcases the power of OpenGL through various features:

Key Features

Dynamic Shadows: Enhance realism and depth within the scene as objects cast and receive shadows with stunning accuracy.

Scene Presentations: An automated camera rotation feature provides a cinematic tour, offering a comprehensive view of the scene's meticulous details from every angle.

Day and Night Cycle: Toggle between day and night modes to witness the scene's transformation and the lighting system's adaptability.

Comprehensive Lighting System: Experience the nuanced effects of directional, spot and point lights, each adding a layer of realism to the scene.

Interactive Animations: Objects within the scene come to life with animations, adding an engaging element to the environment.

Full Camera and Mouse Controls: Navigate through the scene with intuitive camera and mouse movements, allowing for a seamless exploration experience.

Getting Started
To dive into this OpenGL scene, clone the repository and follow the setup instructions provided. Whether you're a graphics enthusiast or a developer looking to explore OpenGL capabilities, this project offers a rich platform for experimentation and learning.

The main object should be extracted from the "Island" folder and added to "objects -> obiect1".
